        <div class="contentTitle"><h1>About the online version</h1></div>
        <div class="contentText">
          <p>The online version is free now, means that you can use our online mesh simplification service for free, note that the speed may vary greatly when users are using the online service simultaneously.</p>
          <p>&nbsp;</p>
	  <p>The online version is suitable for beginner indie developers, the maximum number of vertices per mesh is 65000, so you can not simplify huge 3d models with this version. If you have a huge 3d model, you have to export a low polygon version(less than 65000 vertices per mesh) with your design tool(Blender, LightWave3D, 3DS MAX, Maya etc.), then use the online version to make LOD from within Unity's editor.</p>
          <p>&nbsp;</p>
	  <p>We recommend the standalone version for Unity Free users, and the standard version for Unity Pro users, they are more productive and can simplify huge 3d models directly.</p>
          <p>&nbsp;</p>
	  <p>We reserve the rights of any changes of the free service in future.</p>

        <div class="contentTitle"><h1>How to optimize all meshes in a game object?</h1></div>
        <div class="contentText">
          <p>When you select a game object, if it has any meshes, the interface of Mantis LOD Editor will automatically appear in the inspector window.</p>
          <p>By default, help information shows below each control, you can hide them at any time if you are familiar with the interface.</p>
          <p>Drag the slider will change the qualities of all meshes in the game object simultaneously; if you select a separate mesh in the game object, drag the slider will only change the quality of this mesh.</p>
          <p>The game object will be reverted automatically when it lost focus, been disabled or been destroyed.</p>
          <p>Don't forget to click the 'Save Current Mesh' bar to save the optimized meshes to disk before you leave the interface, otherwise, all your works will lose.</p>
          <p>&nbsp;</p>
        </div>
        <div class="contentTitle"><h1>How to make LOD?</h1></div>
        <div class="contentText">
		   <p>Make sure you have optimized the game object and saved the optimized meshes with different qualities to disk.</p>
		   <p>To make LOD, you need to clone several instances of the game object, then select an instance. The mesh filter or the skinned mesh renderer has a mesh property, you can see it in the inspector window, carefully drag one of the saved mesh with a certain quality from the project window to this mesh property in the inspector window, the instance will automatically become a LOD version of that quality.</p>
          <p>Repeat the above operation, until each instance has different quality, if you don't know how to operate, please watch the tutorial videos to learn.</p>
          <p>You may drag the LOD version to the project window to save it as a prefab for future use.</p>
          <p>&nbsp;</p>
        </div>
        <div class="contentTitle"><h1>How to use the LOD?</h1></div>
        <div class="contentText">
		   <p>After you have made LOD for a game object, you'd better save it as a prefab. Unity3d has excellent documents of how to make and use built-in LOD system in Unity Pro.</p>
          <p>If you are using a free version of Unity, you can switch the LOD versions by distance yourself via a piece of script.</p>
		   <p>Here's the code(C#):</p>
		   <p>float distance = Vector3.Distance(Camera.main.transform.position, gameObject.transform.position);</p>
		   <p>Here's the code(Unity Script):</p>
		   <p>var distance = Vector3.Distance(Camera.main.transform.position, gameObject.transform.position);</p>
		   <p>After you have calculated the distance to the main camera, you can easily switch LOD versions by enable or disable their renderers by script.</p>
